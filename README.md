# Number-Guessing-Game
This repository contains a simple Python-based number guessing game developed using PyCharm. The program generates a random number between a specified range (default: 1 to 100), and the user has to guess the correct number. The game provides feedback on whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct, while keeping track of the total number of attempts.

**Features:**
* Random number generation within a specified range.
* User input validation (checks for non-numeric inputs and out-of-range guesses).
* Real-time feedback on guesses.
* Displays the number of attempts when the correct number is guessed.

**How to Play:**
1) The program prompts the user to guess a number between a given range.
2) If the guess is too low or too high, the user is prompted to guess again.
3) The game continues until the user guesses the correct number.
4) The program displays the correct answer and the total number of guesses.
